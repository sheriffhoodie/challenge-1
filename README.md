# JSON API Web Scraper

This is a simple webpage scraper that returns an input url's h1, h2, h3 and link elements. Simply fork this repo and run it locally by entering "rails s" in the command line. Please note that urls must be entered in complete format, ie they need to begin with "http://" or "https://". The API will then update the page with the results of the indexing, organized into 4 columns. Enjoy!
